     <p> Brisket barbecue is a dish made by cooking a large, tough cut of beef from a cow's lower chest until it's tender and flavorful.
         Brisket is often cooked with indirect heat on a grill or smoker. The meat is seasoned with a dry rub or marinade and then cooked slowly over low heat for several hours.
          The result is a tender, juicy, and flavorful dish that is perfect for a summer barbecue or a casual dinner with friends.

    <p>The ingredients required for making brisket barbecue are brisket, dry rub, barbecue sauce, and wood chips. The brisket is seasoned with a dry rub made from a mixture of spices and herbs. 
        The meat is then cooked slowly over low heat on a grill or smoker. Wood chips are added to the fire to create smoke, which infuses the meat with a rich, smoky flavor. 
        The brisket is basted with barbecue sauce throughout the cooking process to keep it moist and add flavor.
